Setting up urlStreamHandler
===========================

**WARNING**: This plugin tracks your visited urls and saves them to a csv-file,
             be carefull not to store sensitive information.

Recording urls and suggesting next urls makes use of two components:

1. A FireFox Greasemonkey plugin to track visited pages.
2. A Python script that receives the visited urls from the Greasemonkey script,
   stores them to a csv-file and calls a machine learning model to reply with
   the best guesses for next urls.

These two scripts are meant to help you get set up. You are, however, allowed
to change them or reimplement them in another language or browser. The only
requirement is that your program is able to read in csv files with visited urls
and learn from those files.

Installation
------------

1. Install Greasemonkey for FireFox:  
   https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
2. Open urlStreamHandler.user.js using FireFox. A popup will be shown asking
   you to install the URL Stream Handler script.
3. Start urlStreamHandler.py using Python3
4. Start surfing

Uninstalling / deactivating
---------------------------

Killing the urlStreamHandler.py script stops saving urls to file.

To deactivate or uninstall the Greasemonkey script:

- Go to `tools>Greasemonkey>Manage User Scripts ...` or click the Greasemonkey
  icon in the toolbar.
- Click on 'Disable' or 'Remove'.

CSV format
----------

The CSV contains four columns:

1. A time stamp in ISO 8601 format
2. The action type ('load', 'click', 'polling', 'beforeunload')
3. The current url
4. The clicked url (if it is a click action and the target is a `<a>` tag)

Notice that in some situations the click event is not registered (e.g. only on
proper `<a>` tags). Think about data preprocessing to create meaningful streams
for your tasks.
